  We recommend checking with independent settings as soon as possible to find out which device type and IT settings would be most suitable for each pupil.
</p>
<p>
  Depending on availability, you can choose from:
</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">
  Standard Windows laptops
</h2>
<p>
  You’ll be responsible for arranging and maintaining safeguarding measures, like content filtering.
</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">
  DfE Restricted Windows laptops
</h2>
<p>
  These have temporary content filtering and mobile device management software installed, which you’ll need to replace when they expire. You’ll need to reset these devices before you can apply new settings, or download some types of software.
</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">
  Google Chromebooks
</h2>
<p>
  You’ll need to provide us with the relevant school’s email domain for <span class="app-no-wrap">G Suite for Education</span>, and a recovery email address.
