    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">1. Check who is eligible for extra mobile data</h2>

    <p>You can request extra mobile data for disadvantaged children who:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>have no broadband connection at home</li>
      <li>cannot afford additional data</li>
    </ul>

    <p>One of the following must also apply. They are children:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>in years 3 to 11 and whose face-to-face education is disrupted</li>
      <li>who are <a class="govuk-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">extremely clinically vulnerable</a> and need to shield on current official advice (this could be from a doctor or hospital consultant)</li>
      <li>who live in a household that’s been advised to shield because a family member is clinically extremely vulnerable</li>
      <li>who cannot attend school – even though theirs is open – because they live in a different area with local coronavirus restrictions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">2. Use our guide to gather the information you need</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You will need to collect names, telephone numbers and network details from households. They also need to understand how we’ll use their personal information.
    </p>
    <p>Use our guide to tell people what’s available and collect the information you&nbsp;need: </p>

    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">3. Enter the information you collect</h2>

    <p>Once you submit mobile numbers and network details through our service, we’ll request extra data. How much data someone gets will depend on their network.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">4. Check your requests</h2>

    <p>Check whether a network has received and approved your requests.</p>
