    <p>Your school is now eligible to place orders.</p>

    <p>You need to do this on a website called TechSource.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your TechSource account will be ready soon</h2>

    <p>You cannot order devices until your TechSource account is ready. This should be in the next 24 hours. Weâ€™ll email you when you can order.</p>
