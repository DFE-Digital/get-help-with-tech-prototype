  <p>Every school has its own allocation of devices.</p>

  <p>Allocations are based on:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>free school meal numbers</li>
    <li>the number of devices a school already has</li>
    <li>the number of devices a school has already received</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">Numbers will be re-assessed at the time of ordering based on availability and the extent of coronavirus outbreaks.</p>
