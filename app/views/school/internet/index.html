    <p>If a child or young person doesn’t have their own phone, we can increase data on a family member’s phone, as long as they’re in the same household.</p>
    <p>Once you submit mobile numbers and network details through our service, we’ll request extra data. How much data someone gets will depend on their network.</p> -->
