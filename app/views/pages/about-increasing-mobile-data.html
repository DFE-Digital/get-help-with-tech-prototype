# Increasing data allowances on children’s mobile devices

We’re running a pilot scheme to temporarily increase data allowances on certain mobile devices. This is so disadvantaged children and young people can continue their remote education and maintain contact with social care services without incurring extra data charges.

## Who can get help

This support is available to children from early years up to 16, and care leavers up to 25 if they:
don’t have access to a fixed broadband connection
cannot afford the additional data needed to access educational resources or social care services
are an existing customer of a participating mobile network operator (for some operators, they’ll need to be on a pay monthly contract)

## How it will work

We’ve asked a small number of local authorities and academy trusts to work with schools to identify who needs this help, and gather names and numbers from families who want to take part. If you’re a school involved with this work, have a look at our guide to collecting information.

Once local authorities and trusts submit this information via a secure service, we’ll pass it on to participating mobile network operators and they’ll then increase data allowances on nominated devices.
If a child or young person doesn’t have their own phone, we can arrange to increase the data allowance on a family member’s phone, as long as they’re in the same household.

## Who’s on board

Not all mobile network operators are on board yet. The following providers are taking part in the pilot:

* EE
* Three
* Virgin
* Smarty

## Who we’ll share data with

We’ll only share information with mobile network operators for the purpose of increasing data allowances.

## Our plans for national rollout

We’re working hard to get all operators on board for this project. We’ll monitor the pilot and use the feedback we get to improve the service.
