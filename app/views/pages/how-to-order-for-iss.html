# Order laptops and get internet access for <span class="app-no-wrap">state-funded</span> pupils in independent special schools and alternative provision

This guidance explains which pupils are eligible to receive laptops, and how local authorities (LAs) can place orders through the Department for Education’s Get help with technology service.

Independent special schools, alternative providers and pupils cannot order directly. 

We recommend that you get set up to order as soon as possible to make sure you get your preferred choice of laptops.

## Which pupils are eligible for this support

The Department for Education (DfE) is providing laptops to support disadvantaged pupils in years 3 to 11, who:

- have a funded place at an independent special school, or independent alternative provision
- are eligible for free school meals
- do not have access to a suitable device for remote education, and for use in face-to-face education

LAs can [request internet access for eligible pupils](#) too.

## How to get laptops and internet access

### 1. Check your local authority’s laptop allocation

DfE has asked each LA to nominate one or more staff members to order laptops and request internet access for eligible pupils. 

If you’ve been nominated to order, we’ll email your LA’s estimated laptop allocation to you. If you have not received this email, [contact us](#).

Your estimate is based on the data your local authority submitted in the latest published alternative provision census (2020).

You’re allocated one laptop for each pupil in years 3 to 11 that you reported as:

- having a state-funded place at an independent special school, or independent alternative provision
- also being eligible for free school meals (FSM)

You can request internet access for these pupils if they need it too.

#### Tell us if your allocation is wrong

Your estimate is based on the data your local authority submitted in the latest published alternative provision census (2020).

You’re allocated one laptop for each pupil in years 3 to 11 that you reported as:

- having a state-funded place at an independent special school, or independent alternative provision
- also being eligible for free school meals (FSM)

You can request internet access for these pupils if they need it too.

### 2. Check what pupils need

We recommend contacting pupils, families or schools as soon as possible to find out the following information.

#### Laptops

To order laptops, you need to find out which:

- eligible pupils do not have access to a laptop
- type of laptop and IT settings are most suitable for each pupil (if they need Google Chromebooks, you should ask for their school’s domain for G Suite for Education, and recovery email address — you’ll need to tell us this after you place your order)

#### Internet access

To request internet access, you need to find out which:

- eligible pupils do not have internet access at home
- type of internet support is most suitable for each pupil (you also need to gather mobile phone information if you want to request extra data for pupils on participating networks)

You do not need to complete this step before moving on to step 3.

### 3. Complete and submit your contact details form

We need some information from you to set up your Get help with technology service account, even if you’ve used the service before. You’ll place your orders using this account.

If you’ve been nominated to order for your LA, you’ll receive an email with a link to an online form. You need to use that form to tell us:

1. Your full name.
2. Your local authority name and 3-digit code.
3. The delivery address we should send your laptops to (all devices will be delivered to the same location at your local authority).
4. The person we should contact when we deliver your laptops.

If you’ve been nominated to order but have not received an email with a link to the form, [contact us](#).

Once you’ve completed and submitted your form, it will take up to 5 working days for us to set up your account. We’ll let you know as soon as you can sign in and order.

### 4. Order laptops and request internet access

Once you complete steps 1 to 3 and your ordering account is set up, you’ll receive an email to let you know.

You can then sign in to the Get help with technology service to order laptops. You can also request internet access for eligible pupils.

You can order all of your allocation at once, or place multiple orders.

### 5. Receive laptops

All of your laptops will be delivered to the local authority address you provided in your contact details form.

Most deliveries will arrive within 5 working days after you place your order.

### 6. Laptop ownership, safeguarding and providing IT support

Your local authority will own these laptops, and be responsible for making sure they have [appropriate safety and security measures installed and maintained](#).

You’ll be responsible for lending these laptops to state-funded pupils who need them, and redistributing them if pupils move school or leave education.
