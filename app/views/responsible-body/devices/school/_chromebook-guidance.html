<p>If you are going to order Google Chromebooks, we’ll need 2 pieces of information to configure them:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
  {% if isSchool %}
  <li>the domain your school uses for its Google services</li>
  {% else %}
  <li>the domain a school uses for its Google services</li>
  {% endif %}
  <li>the school’s recovery email address</li>
</ul>

<p>We need this information so we can secure the devices.</p>

  If you need help finding these details email <a href="#">COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk</a>
