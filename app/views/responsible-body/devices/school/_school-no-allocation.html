    <p>They can still <a href="/responsible-body/devices/request-devices">request devices for specific circumstances</a>.</p>

    <p>Reasons for a 0 allocation can include:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the school has no children in the eligible year groups, years 3 to 11</li>
      <li>there are very few children on free school meals according to the most recent census data</li>
      <li>there was not sufficient data to calculate an allocation – for example it’s a new school</li>
    </ul>

    {% if showForms %}
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">We still need some information</h3>

      <p>If they will request and order their own devices we need to know who to contact at the school.
      <p>If you are managing their requests centrally we need to know if they will want Google Chromebooks.</p>
