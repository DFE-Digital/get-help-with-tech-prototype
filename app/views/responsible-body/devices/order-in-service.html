      How you order devices has changed
    </h2>

    <p>You can now place orders directly on this service. You no longer need to sign in to TechSource.</p>

    <p>Most devices will be delivered within 5 working days.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Combining allocations into one order
    </h2>
    <p>You can combine allocations for your schools and colleges, and have devices delivered to one location.</p>
    <p>If you want devices delivered directly to different locations, place a separate order for each delivery address.</p>
