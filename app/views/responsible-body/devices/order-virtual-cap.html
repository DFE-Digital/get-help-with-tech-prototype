      <p>It ’s important to know how many devices you can order before you sign in. If you try to order more than you’ve been allocated, the order will be cancelled.</p>

      Ordering devices for more than one school
    </h3>
    <p>
      You can combine allocations for all your schools, and have all devices delivered to one place. If you want different schools to get devices directly, place a separate order for each delivery address.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using TechSource, you will be asked for a URN. Use any URN for one of the schools you manage.
    </p>
    {# <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Chromebooks</h3>
    <p>
      If you place an order for Chromebooks, TechSource will contact you about which ‘G Suite for Education’ domains you want to use.
