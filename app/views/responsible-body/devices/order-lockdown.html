      How to order devices for more than 1 school
    </h2>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Ordering Chromebooks</h2>
    <p>
      When ordering Chromebooks, you need to place separate orders for schools with different G Suite for Education domains. This is because they need to be set up differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using TechSource, you will be asked for a URN. Use any URN of the school that has the G Suite domain you want to use for the Chromebooks.
    </p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Orders that do not include Chromebooks</h2>
    <p>
      You can combine allocations for all your schools, and have all devices delivered to one place. If you want different schools to get devices directly, place a separate order for each delivery address.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using TechSource, you will be asked for a URN. Use any URN for one of the schools you manage.
