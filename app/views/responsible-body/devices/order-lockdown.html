      How to order devices for more than 1 school
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can combine allocations for all your schools, and have all devices delivered to one place. If you want different schools to get devices directly, place a separate order for each delivery address.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using TechSource, you will be asked for a URN. Use any URN for one of the schools you manage.

      Devices will be delivered within 2 working days.
