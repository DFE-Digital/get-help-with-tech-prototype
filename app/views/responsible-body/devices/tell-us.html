  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Decide if schools can order their own devices</h2>

  <p>You can allow schools to order their own devices. Or you can manage some, or all, orders centrally.</p>

  {% if data.trust %}
    <p>If you let schools place orders you’ll need to nominate someone in each school for us to contact.</p>

    <p>Each contact will be able to:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>manage who can order devices</li>
      <li>order devices themselves</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We recommend letting schools place orders because it’s the quickest way to get help to those who need it.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Help schools prepare for disruption</h2>

    <p>Give us contact details as soon as you can so we can help schools prepare to deliver remote education if they need to.</p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Orders can only be placed when local coronavirus restrictions are confirmed</h2>

  <p>We’ll contact people as soon as they’re able to place orders.</p>

  <p>Orders placed before 4pm will normally be delivered to schools the next working day.</p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Each school has their own allocation</h2>

  <p>Every school has its own provisional allocation of laptops and tablets. Allocations are based on free school meal data and estimates of how many devices a school has already received.</p>
