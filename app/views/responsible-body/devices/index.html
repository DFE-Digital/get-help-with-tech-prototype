  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Schools can now order their own devices</h2>

  <p>Schools will be able to order their own devices in the event of a local coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.</p>
  <p>We recommend you let schools order their own devices because this is the quickest way to get help to those who need it.</p>

  <p>Youâ€™ll need to nominate someone in each school for us to contact.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, you can nominate contacts to manage some or all orders centrally.</p>

  <p>Each contact will be able to:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>manage who can order devices for their school</li>
    <li>order devices themselves</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- <p>
    All nominated contacts will receive:
  </p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>access to this service to add and edit who can make orders in their school</li>
    <li>access to the TechSource system for placing orders</li>
    <li>detailed instructions for how to place an order in the event of a local coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak that affects their school(s) or pupils</li>
  </ul> -->

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Prepare before a lockdown</h2>

  <p>Give us school details as soon as you can so we can contact them, and they can prepare before a local lockdown.</p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Orders can only be placed during a lockdown</h2>

  <p>Schools that are closed or partially closed because of a local lockdown will be notified that they can now place orders for devices.</p>

  <p>Orders placed before 4pm will be delivered to schools the next working day.</p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Each school has their own allocation</h2>

  <p>Every school has its own allocation of devices. Allocations are based on free school meals and estimates of the number of devices a school already has.</p>

  <p>Numbers will be re-assessed at the time of ordering based on availability and the extent of coronavirus outbreaks.</p>
