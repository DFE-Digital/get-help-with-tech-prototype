    </h2>

    <p>We’re working with mobile companies to temporarily increase data allowances on certain networks. This is so children can continue their remote education without incurring extra data charges.</p>
    <p>If they do not have their own phone, we can increase data on a family member’s phone, as long as they’re in the same household.</p>
    <p>If they do not have access to a mobile device, or are not on a participating network a 4G wireless router might be more suitable.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If your school is facing disruption to education and you’ve been invited to order devices, you can request 4G wireless routers.
